    <p>bookshelf is a web api that helps you track your reading habits. log and reviews books to your account, and access previously read books with ease.</p>
    <h2>documentation</h2>
    <p>For this project, I choose to make a web api that can create a user and add books to the user's 'shelf'.
         The part of the app that the API handles is keeping track of user information, as well as handeling the 
         GET, HEAD, and POST requests. It also handles all of the different codes and returns them to the web page. 
         The HTML page processed and displays the information recieved from the API in visually apealing ways. 
         I didn't run into anything that went horribly wrong, but I did have to adjust the way that the table is displayed 
         and ran into some trouble displaying the forms. With the help of a few tutorials (linked both in code and below) I 
         was able to fix my problems. If I were to continue, I would want to make it a legit web app, where users log in and 
         can see all the books and reviews that they've logged. I would also make a more robust search, so that users would be able 
         to retrieve specific data rather than just getting back their whole list of books logged. I would want to expand this to make
         an app similar to letterboxd, where users can follow and see other's reviews of movies. This was bascially inspired but my 
         hatred of Good Reads and the desire to make a better designed app to track reading logs. My app went above and beyond through
         design and data presentation, from the pop-up forms to the 'bookself' display. It is minimalism, but I thik it fits the theme of the app well 
         and looks quite nice. I spent a lot of time messing with the css to get it to look so cohesive. I also am proud 
         of the 'total pages' feature, which tracks the amount of pages logged in total and compiles that information on the web page side.
